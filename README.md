#### hello world <3 this is my personal website! it was created this while i was dying of covid and had to quarantine for 10 days ugh, special thanks to the static website generator jekyll. i used a template since i didn't know how to code html and css at the tiime. i'm going to make a 2.0 version of this website since it was incredibly basic ngl.
